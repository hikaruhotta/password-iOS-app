### Create a team skills matrix
Make a table showing areas of expertise relevant to your project and showing gaps that will likely need filling. 

You can do this [directly in your README.md](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet#tables), embed a picture, or link a document.

An example is below. You may want to use the 6 Hats Survey results and other data then what is shown in this example.
